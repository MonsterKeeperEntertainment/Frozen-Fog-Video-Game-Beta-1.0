# Frozen-Fog-Video-Game-Beta-1.0
A video game project made with Unreal Engine 4.8. This game is a very basic project. The first one that I have kind-of finished. If you want to play a Beta 1.0 of a stealth shooter, this could be fun. The Ai is really crappy.

the controls for the game are pretty simple. aswd for movement, space for jump, left click for shoot, r for reload. to grab a ledge, run at it and jump at the last second. great thanks on this game to crocopede, who helped me with the ledge climb, and Ben from unrealtutorials.com that helped me with the matinee.

# What is Frozen Fog?

well, frozen fog is my first project in unreal engine. i am going to make more games of this gerne, because i love stealth games. we will try to do more other gernes, too, but i am going to be most happy about stealth shooter releases.

# Does this work on Mac?

actually, that is all that frozen fog works for so far. send me a comment on my website www.monsterkeeper.com to request a build for PS4 or XBOX1. sorry, but windows and linux arent supported.

# Give Me Feedback!

give me a comment on the frozen fog page of my website www.monsterkeeper.com and complain about how bad this game sucked! developers love when people complain. then we can make the game better next time.
